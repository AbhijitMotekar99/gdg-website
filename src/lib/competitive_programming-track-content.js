    extendedContent: `Competitive programming is both an art and a science that combines problem-solving skills with efficient coding practices. This track introduces you to the world of algorithmic programming contests and helps you develop the skills needed to excel in competitions like ICPC, Google Code Jam, and Codeforces.

In this track, you'll progress from basic programming concepts to advanced algorithmic techniques. You'll learn how to:
- Write efficient and optimized code
- Analyze problem constraints and complexity
- Choose appropriate data structures
- Implement advanced algorithms
- Handle edge cases and stress testing

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, programming competitions, or simply want to improve your problem-solving skills, this track provides a structured path to mastery. You'll practice with real contest problems, learn optimization techniques, and develop the speed and accuracy needed for competitive programming.`,
